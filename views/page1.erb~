<h1> About Us </h1>
<h2> History of WoollySheep.com </h2>
<p> The idea of the website started when I was taught how to crochet by an 18 year old boy. He was making money for his Ski tryps and was selling the hats to his class mates. I started to do this myself and then decided to set up my own website to design and sell one of a kind hats.</p>
